"""Unified SQLite access seam (kernel Phase 0, docs/KERNEL_PLAN.md).

Today stores open connections several different ways — some with
``sqlite3.connect(path, factory=ClosingConnection)`` and a timeout, others with a
bare ``sqlite3.connect(path)`` that never sets a busy-timeout and relies on GC to
close. This module is the one canonical opener plus a home for schema migrations,
so every store can converge on a single pattern over time.

**No schema merge** (explicitly out of scope per the plan): each store keeps its
own database file and its own tables. This seam only removes the drift in *how*
connections are opened, and sequences/records migrations so they run exactly once.

Pure-ish: imports only stdlib and the integration's own ``sqlite_utils``; no Home
Assistant import, so it is unit-testable without HA.
