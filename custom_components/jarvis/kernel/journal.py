"""Execution journal + crash recovery (kernel hardening H4, docs/KERNEL_PLAN.md).

The planner (`kernel.plan`) runs a plan step-by-step in memory. If the process
dies mid-plan — a restart, a crash, a power blip — that in-memory progress is
lost, and on the next boot nobody knows whether the step that was *running* at the
time actually took effect. The audit flagged this: JARVIS can act, but it cannot
pick up where it left off.

This module is the durable record. Each step's lifecycle is written through
``kernel.persistence`` as it happens:

    record_plan → start_step(RUNNING) → finish_step(DONE / FAILED / …)

so after a restart ``in_flight()`` returns exactly the steps that were started but
never resolved. :func:`recover` then re-checks each against live state (via an
injected ``verify`` callable — "did this actually happen?") and settles it:
verified → DONE, otherwise flagged ``NEEDS_REPLAY`` for the caller to re-run,
honouring the plan's idempotency so recovery never double-acts.

Storage goes through the one persistence seam (its own DB file, its own tables —
no schema merge). No Home Assistant import; the live checks are injected, so the
journal and recovery are deterministic and unit-testable on a real temp DB.
