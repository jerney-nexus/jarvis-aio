"""Authority / capability engine (kernel Phase 4, docs/KERNEL_PLAN.md).

The safety keystone: one place that answers "may this capability be exercised,
by this actor, in this context?" with **allow / deny / confirm**. Today that
judgement is spread across `voice_confirm` (is this action protected?),
`output_gate` (may we interrupt?) and the autonomy grants; this module gives them
a single, testable check to delegate to, and a capability-**token** model so a
delegated sub-agent (FRIDAY / HOMER) can never exercise more than it was granted.

Design invariants (from the kernel plan):
  * **No escalation by delegation.** A token-bearing actor is denied any
    capability its token does not grant, and a derived token can only *narrow*
    its parent's capabilities, never widen them.
  * **Security-sensitive capabilities require explicit authority** — they resolve
    to CONFIRM (or DENY without an identified requester), never a silent allow.
  * **Fail closed.** Any error in a policy resolves to DENY.

Pure: no Home Assistant import, no I/O — trivially testable. **Phase 4 ships this
additively, to run log-only / allow-as-before first**: callers compute the
engine's decision alongside their existing behaviour and record parity before any
actuator is actually routed through it.
