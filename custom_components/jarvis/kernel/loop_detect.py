"""Feedback-loop detection (kernel hardening H3, docs/KERNEL_PLAN.md).

An automation system that both *reacts to* and *produces* events can chase its
own tail: an action changes a state, the state change is an event, the event
triggers the same action again — a thrash loop that burns the actuator and the
logs. The audit called out that JARVIS has no single place that notices this.

This is that place. The caller feeds it each action as it fires, optionally with
the id of the event that *caused* it; the detector returns a verdict:

    * **repetition** — the same action fired too many times inside a window
      (the classic "flapping" loop), or
    * **self_trigger** — the action was caused, through the event chain, by an
      earlier firing of the *same* action (a true A → event → A cycle), or
    * nothing, and a short **cooldown** after a loop is flagged so the caller can
      break the cycle rather than re-detect it every tick.

Pure: no Home Assistant import, no I/O, no wall clock — ``now`` is passed in, so
the detector is deterministic and unit-testable. It never acts; it only reports.
The caller decides whether to suppress, back off, or alert (and, once wired, how
this feeds `attention` / `priority`).
